# Resource-Quota :

~ We have studied about namespaces where namespaces are used to group resources(pods)
~ K8S cluster can be divided into namespaces
~ All Pods running in the K8S observed so far have not been set to limit for any resources

~ The Pods in K8S will run with no limitations of memory and CPU by default
~ We can limit the Pod w.r.t. setting the limits for CPU,memory or storage by creating a namespace

~ In this namespace we configure some limitations , I.e. only one CPU,One GB of RAM, etc.
	—>  The Pods are created only until the limit is reached
~ For now, we have never added arguments(resource Limitations) for Pods , But we can specify it in the yml file itself

*It’s like creating an isolated network

Eg. resource-quota-namespace.yml
---
apiVersion: v1 
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: rq-app
  namespace: ankush-ns
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "5"
    limits.cpu: "1"
    limits.memory: 1Gi
...


Eg. resource-quoda-deployment.yml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deployemntsvc
  labels:
    name: ankush
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ankush
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ankush
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: container1
        image: hacker123shiva/springbt-in-docker:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "0.3"
            memory: 333Mi
...

*As In the above manifest-yml namespace is configured to have 5 pods, 1 CPU and memory to be 1 GB
*The resource-quoda-deployment.yml is applied to deploy 3 pos, each consuming 0.3 times the part of Cpu and 333mb of memory

So, when we run “kunectl get quota”
We’ll see pods to be 3/5
Cpu to be 0.9/1
Memory to be 999/Gi

And when we run “kubectl get pods” we’ll get only 3 pods
Even if we increase replicas —> 5
We’ll only get 3 replicas due to the limitations
