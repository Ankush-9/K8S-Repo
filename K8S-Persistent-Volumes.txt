# Persistent Volume(PV) :

~ If we delete Pod, data is also lost ,this is because data is stored locally on the pod ==> stateless
~ Every pod created for now is stateless

~ If we delete a Pod and data is persistent i.e. present permanently ==> stateful
~ We can store data in external storage such as AWS EBS,etc….

~ K8S Persistent Volume helps us to manage storage for applications(pods) running in K8S cluster
~ The Pods and storage we’ll be creating will be independent of each other and we’ll have to connect them
~ Therefore , Persistent Volumes are independent of pods and they exist even if pods are not using them
