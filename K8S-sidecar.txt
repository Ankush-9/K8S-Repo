# K8S Sidecar :
~ In a Multi-container pod ,where we have multiple containers(running instances of images)
~ If there exists a relationship between the containers ->One is the app runner while the other acts as a helper to the main container
~ The helper container is called the sidecar ,technically

# K8S Sidecar MultiContainer Pattern :
~ It is basically used to enhance the functionality of a primary application
~ Sidecar handles cross cutting concern I.e. the supporting logic
~ Sidecar pattern ->To enhance and Support the main application at the run-time

#Eg. YAML-File for above illustration :(hardcoded from internet)
