K8S Namespaces:

~ Namespaces are used to group the resources
~ eg . Frontend-app-pods —> frontend-app-ns
	   Backend-app-pods —> backend-app-ns
	   Database-pods —> database-ns

~ We can perform the above in K8S Namespaces but if we delete the Namespace whatever resources are present in a namespace, they get delete as well
~ By default we have 4 namespaces
~ If we do not mention any namespace while the pod creation in the manifest file we’ll be working on default namespace
~ The other 3 namespaces are for internal cluster operations

*We can create our own namespace by using the following command ~ 
~ kubectl create ns ankush-ns
~ kubectl get namespace

*We can also create a namespace using the manifest file ~
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ankush-ns-2
...

Commands :

~ kubectl get ns or ,  			—> This command lists all the namespaces 
   Kubectl get namspace

~ To get information about a pod or service in a particular namespace use the commands as ~
	kubectl get pods -n <namespace-nae>
	kubectl get service -n <namespace-name>

~ kubectl delete ns <name-space-name>  --> This command is used to delete a namepsace by it's name

# Running a Pod in a particular namespace can be performed as ~

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webapp
  namespace: ankush-ns
spec:
  container
    - name: javawebcontainer
      image: hacker123shiva/springbt-in-docker:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080    
...

*After Deleting a namespace all pods and services within it are also deleted.
