# Kubernetes (K8S):

~ Kubernetes is a free and open source tool/software.
~ Kubernetes is developed by Google and currently being maintained by CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation).
~ Go Programming Language has been used to develop Kubernetes

~ Kubernetes is an orchestration Platform.
~ Used to manage Containers( create/start/stop/delete/scale-up/scale-down).
~ It provides framework for managing the complex task of deploying an application, scaling and operating applications in containers.

* Kubernetes is basically used to deploy the application.
 —> Also no. Of instances can be increased/decreased ,scaled up/down as per traffic ,management and maintenance of application can be performed using K8S.
 —> Also monitoring of app comes under K8S which has further 2 sub-divisions 
	1) Monitoring the application
	2) Monitoring the infrastructure

~ For now, Kubernetes is used to deploy applications,It is easy to scale, manage and monitor application using K8S.  

~ Major Advantages of K8S ~
    	1) Self Healing : If any container gets crashed or encounters a major issue, it is replaced with a new container.
	2) Auto-scaling : Based on demand or traffic the no. Of containers are scaled up or scaled down.
	3) Load Balancing : Load will be distributed among all containers which are up and running.

# Difference between Docker and K8S : 

~ Docker is famous for containerisation (packaging our app code and dependencies as a single unit for execution) while,
    K8S is famous for orchestration platform(management of containers)

# Kubernetes Architecture :

~ Here, we use multiple nodes I.e. we use the concept of cluster(multiple machines) here
~ We directly work on the Control node, which takes care of operations on the Worker node 
~ In Industry for 85% cases we use the provider’s Clusters and in that as well most popular is the AWS EKS

1. Control Node/Plane(Master Node) : 
	—> API Server
	—> Schedular
	—> Controller Manager
	—> ETCD	
2. Worker Node :
	—> kublet
	—> kube proxy
	—> POD
	—> Container
	—> Docker

~ To deploy our app using K8S we need to communicate with Control Plane,The master node
~ We Create a machine on our cloud where we install and use KUBECTL (CLI) to communicate with control plane
~ We have many components within Control and worker nodes

—> API Server : It will receive the request given by KUBECTL and stores the request with pending status in the database of our cluster i.e. ETCD
—> Schedular : It identifies the pending tasks/requests in ETCD and it identifies worker node to schedule the task using kubelet present in each Worker node
—> Controller Manager : The duty of Controller Manager is to verify all tasks (Proper working of tasks as per expectations)
—> ETCD : It is an internal database of k8s cluster

—> kubelet : Schedular identifies worker node using kubelet. kubelet is  a node agent which maintains information about all worker nodes
—> kube-proxy : It provides network for cluster-communication. It is basically used to take care of networking in K8S cluster
—> PODS :  Pod is the smallest building block in K8S cluster. Every App is deployed as a pod in k8s. We can have multiple pods for a single instance of an application
—> Containers : Containers are running instances of an application which are present inside Pods.
—> Docker : It is installed in every Worker Node to take care of Containerization i.e. to run the Docker containers

# Notes:

*API Server is the entry point for all our commands.
*Generally everything in Kubernetes is represented as a pod.
*To Create a pod we use yml file which is often referred as Manifest yml (within which we will configure our Docker Images)
*If a Pod is damaged/deleted/crashed then k8s will create a new Pod(Self-healing property)
*If an app runs on multiple pods then K8S automatically distributed the load to all the pods(Load Balancing Property) with the help of Load Balancers
*Pods can be increased or decreased automatically based on the traffic/load (Auto-Scaling property)

# K8S Cluster Setup :

~ Mini Cube —> Single node Cluster —> Only for practice or to get started with k8s

~ Kubeadm Cluster —> Self managed cluster —> We manage and are responsible for everything

~ Provider Managed Cluster —> Ready Made Cluster —> Provider will take care of everything
	—> eg. AWS EKS ,AZURE AKS, GCP GKE etc…….
	-> Provider Managed Clusters are paid(chargeable)
