# AutoScaling :
~ Autoscaling is the process of increasing/decreasing infrastructure resources based on the demand(app traffic, memory, CPU).
~ Scaling is of two types :
	—> Horizontal Scaling
	—> Vertical Scaling

# Horizontal Scaling:
~ It refers to increasing the no. Of machines/servers 
	eg. We have 3 pods and as traffic increases Pods are increased to 6
~ Kubernetes supports Horizontal Scaling and is widely used
~ Scale out —> increasing resources(pods/servers)
~ Scale in —> decreasing resources

# Vertical Scaling:
~ In Vertical Pod Scaling we increase resources of same system i.e. the capacities
~ eg. It is like having 4 CPUs instead of 2 CPUs, 4GB ram instead of 2 GB ram
~ It is less common than Vertical Scaling
~ Scale up —> increasing the resources
~ Scale down —> decreasing the capacity(resources)

#Note:
*In K8S Vertical Scaling is less common because Pods are meant to be light-weight, but we can use Vertical Pod autoscaler(by installing and configuring some components)

# HPA :
~ HPA stands for Horizontal Pod Autoscaler(or Autoscaling)

# VPA :
~ VPA stands for Vertical Pod Autoscaler(or Autoscaling)

# Requirements:
~ We require Kubernetes Metric Server —> also called Heapster
~ Heapster is a deprecated version of Metric Server

# Kubernetes Metric Server:
~ It is used to monitor the overall health and performance of K8S cluster, providing data needed for Kubernetes features like HPA
~ HPA interacts with this Metric Server to identify CPU/memory utilization of POD
~ This Metric server collects information like CPU , RAM , etc. for all pods and nodes in the cluster
~ Metric server will not be present by default in K8S cluster, it requires installation

#Installation of Heapster:
~ Use any of the Ai tools to get help in installation of K8S Metric Server

~ Follow the commands below to install k8s metric server:
	kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml

	kubectl patch deployment metrics-server -n kube-system \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[
    {"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-","value":"--kubelet-insecure-tls"},
    {"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-","value":"--kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP"},
    {"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-","value":"--kubelet-use-node-status-port"}
  ]'

	kubectl rollout restart deployment metrics-server -n kube-system

	 kubectl get pods -n kube-system

	kubectl top nodes

	kubectl top pods -A
