# K8S ReplicaSet :

~ Replica basically refers to a copy,
~ This is used for managing multiple replicas of Pods to perform activities like LoadBalancing and scaling
~ It will create multiple replicas of same pod (we can use same application with multiple pods)
~ Even if one Pod is deleted, it will automatically create another Pod —> Self-Healing Property of K8S
~ Depends on the requirement I.e. traffic, we can scale the pods

# ReplicaSet Manifest File :

~ kubectl apply -f <yml-file-name>

# Commands :

~ kubectl get rs —> It will show the replicates created 
~ kubectl get rs -o wide —> It shows more information about the replicates created
~ kubectl describe rs <name-of-replicaset> —> It describes the information about a specific replicatset in a detailed manner
~ kubectl get pods —showl-abels —> It displays the Pods with label names used by selector
~ kubectl get pods —watch —> It is used to observe what is happening with the pods
~ kubectl scale rs/<rs-name> —replicas=<no. Of desired instances>  —> It is used to scale either up or scale down as per given no. Of replicas
~ kubectl delete pods <pod-name> —> It is used to delete a named pod.
~ kubectl describe pods -l app=<name-of-app> | grep -I Image	 —> It is used to display information about the Image of our app which is used by the pod

# Observations :

*ReplicaSet gives ability to easily run multiple instances of a pod(app)
*ReplicaSet is not recommended for Application updates/changes to an existing pod created from a manifest-yml file
*Auto-Scaling is also not possible 
*Only manual scaling is possible in ReplicaSet
