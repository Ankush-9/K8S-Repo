Notes :

Summary ~
Everything in K8S manifest file is case sensitive.
Eg. Pod is correct while POD is incorrect.
       apiVersion is accepted while ApiVersion is not.

—> apiVersion : It is the version we have to specify (It’s not of our own choice).
		     Here, using apiVersion we tell K8S which library version to be used for the object being created (kind).
		     It is predefined. 
		     Depending on K8S object we want to create we have to specify the corresponding version.

Eg. Pod : v1
      Service: v1
      NameSpace : v1
      ReplicaSet : apps/v1
      Deployment : apps?v1

*We have to be very careful while defining apiVersion

~ kubectl api-resources : This command is used to get all the resources being used and At the time of specifying we can check what version to use.
~ kubectl api-versions : It is used to display the API versions currently supported by the Kubernetes API server that your kubectl client is configured to communicate with.

—>  kind : It is used to define the type of Kubernetes object we want to use
	eg. Pod,Deployment,Service,….etc.

—> metadata : It is used to mention the information about K8S object we’re creating.
	 eg. name, labels,……etc.
	name is the name of the deployment while label is the name given to access specific Pod. Label is a key-value pair used for organising and selecting object.

—> spec: <container>
	Specification of the K8S object,It defines how the traffic is routed for services and the container details for Pods
	(Contains container info related to image name, port mapping , environment variables and so on……)
