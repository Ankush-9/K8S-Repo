# HELM
=========================
~ We have package managers as
	Amazon Linux/Red hat : yum
	Ubuntu : apt
~ Likewise, HELM is also a package manager to install the required softwares in k8s cluster
~ It is basically an easier approach to install required softwares similar to yum/apt package managers in Linux Distributions

~ HELM uses charts in order to achieve this
~ Charts refers to collection of configuration files i.e. all the manifest-yml files
~ Using HELM charts we can install Prometheus server ,Grafana Server,….and so on
